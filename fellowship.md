title: Constraining Arctic Carbon-Cycle Feedbacks
permalink: /fellowship/
---

In October 2018 I started a five year independent research fellowship funded by the [Natural Environment Research Council](https://nerc.ukri.org). My aim is to answer a big question: What will happen to carbon stores in Arctic soils and plants as the climate changes? This has implications for how much carbon humans can emit through burning fossil fuels, to meet [climate change targets](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement).
