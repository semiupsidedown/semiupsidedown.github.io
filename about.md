I am a research scientist based in Exeter, UK (currently my time is split between the University of Exeter and the Met Office). I have also been working for 4 months in Bergen, Norway in 2017.

I study Arctic permafrost and the carbon cycle using computer modelling: I develop models that replicate measurements from the Arctic, and then run them to simulate the future. My research helps to understand the links between the Arctic land surface and the global climate.

### Current Projects

COUP: COnstraining Uncertainties in the Permafrost-climate feedback

CLIFFTOP: Climate Feedbacks From Wetlands and Permafrost Thaw in a Warming World
