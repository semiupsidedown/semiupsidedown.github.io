I am a research scientist based in at the University of Exeter, UK. I also spend part of my time at the Met Office, and have spent some time working in Bergen, Norway.

I study Arctic permafrost and the carbon cycle using computer modelling: I develop models that replicate measurements from the Arctic, and then run them to simulate the future. I also analyse large numbers of measurements to detect patterns. My research helps to understand the links between the land surface and the global climate.
