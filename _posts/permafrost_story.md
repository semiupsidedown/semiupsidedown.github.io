title: "A permafrost story"
---

I've been reading a book recently about how we should tell our research as a story. So on the spur of the moment, while 
spending the evening in an airbnb in Edinburgh, I wrote down my story on paper just as it came to my mind.

On Friday I'll be speaking at an Arctic meeting here at the University of Edinburgh, and 
I'm planning to make my talk more of a story. Probably everyone will think I'm weird but it's worth a try.
