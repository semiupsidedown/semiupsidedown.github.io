title: "New paper: Microbes, methane, and global warming"
---

My latest paper was published in its final form last week. It's been a long wait! Feel free to take a look at 
the [paper itself](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GB006678), or read on for my thoughts...

#### The story

It was several years ago that microbes first caught my attention. Microscopic life forms: bacteria, fungi and many more, live beneath our feet and these tiny little living beings, in their astronomical numbers, are engineers of the Earth's climate.

In total, they emit greenhouse gases at around **six times** the rate that humans do. The reason that this hasn't caused a huge problem is because it's part of a closed cycle. Microbes release carbon from the soil (in the form of greenhouse gases), and plants absorb it and put it back in again, in a continuously cycling loop. Interrupting this loop, by removing plants, for example, can lead to an imbalance and to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate change might also lead to an imbalance, since there's no reason to expect that microbes and plants will react in the same way to global warming. This is something we are pretty worried about, since if global warming causes huge carbon emissions from the soil, this could jeopardise our efforts to keep climate change below safe levels.
